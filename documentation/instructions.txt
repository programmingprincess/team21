Play Instructions: 
Three dice will be used in this game. The goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of 200 total points. 

1. Each player takes turns rolling the dice. A player's turn is terminated when they roll a sum of 10 or 11, roll three 6's, or when they choose to hold. Rolling three 6's will render a player's total score to 0. Rolling 10 or 11 will render a player's score during that round to 0. 

2. Rolling three of a kind (other than 6's) will allow player to triple their score for that roll. (For example: rolling three 3's will result in a score of 9 x 3 = 27). If a player rolls three one's, each die will be treated as a value of 6 instead of one. (Rolling three 1's will result in a score of 6 x 3 = 18 x 3 = 54). 

3. The game will terminate a player reaches the scoring threshold. The highest score takes the win!
